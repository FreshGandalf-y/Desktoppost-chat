I use this Interface and the Database () on a raspberry-pi-Server on my home-network. 

I whant to build a side, where you can post your unix like Desktop, No Windows! (but it is ok when you show, you´re running windows Vista on a toaster or a car).
I also whant to buid a chat-function on this side, where you can write something, and it will be written on a mySQL database. 

Since yet i build the interface and the js behind the input tag, but i already learn node.js, python, and MySql, and later i whant to learn WebSockets. 

I hope you like it 👍. 

Bugs: 

I can´t print data from 'chatResponse' (main.js ln34,col5) and i don´t know how to handle the chatmessages, from other Persons. Maybe i write all 'chatResponse' in a json File, and reed it with an for i loop? 
I don´t know how to do this...

I have no username and password permittion, becouse the MySQL Database does´nt work, so i can not make a user request, to show the Dashbord.

So... the database does´nt work, i never coding with pyhon before, i will fix that later. 

The Desktop.html isn´t reddy now, but i whant to build a flexible page, to show your unix-like Desktop. 
But the database dosn´t work yet...
