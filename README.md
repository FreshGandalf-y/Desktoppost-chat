I use this Interface on a raspberry-pi-Server on my home-network. 

I whant to build a side, where you can post your unix like Desktop, No Windows! (but it is ok wenn you show that you running windows Vista on a toaster or a car).
I also whant to buid a chat-function un this side, where you can write something, and it will be written on a mySQL database. 

Since yet i build the interface and the js behind the input tag, but i already learn node.js, python, and MySql, and later i whant to learn WebSockets. 

I hope you like it 👍.
